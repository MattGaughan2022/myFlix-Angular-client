# myFlix Angular Web App

Using a MERN stack API ([repo](https://github.com/MattGaughan2022/nodeMovieAPI)), the user is able to register and login to a movie database.

The movie database displays various movie cards (Angular Material mat-grid-tiles / list).

Users can interact with buttons located in the footer of each card to view more information about a movie, or 'favorite' a movie.

Accessing the user profile page brings up a mat-tab showcasing the user's info, including movies favorited.
